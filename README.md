# FS22_BaNe
Business Administration & National Economy Mod for FS22

This mod has the purpose to make different economical settings tweakable with the help of an ingame menu.
A goal that I wish to achieve is to make it as neglectable as possible so that deleting the mod and going vanilla will not break your savegame entirely.
As this is my first mod for Giants' FS-series and the first mod on pure LUA-base I'm most thankful for constructive critic.

Please don't spread the mod (yet) without talking to me first.
Don't copy or modify and publish the code without my permission.
Just talk to me - I am a most reasonable person, I guess.

Most of the mod was born out of boredom and the fact that I love challenges.
If you have any wishes to extend the functionalities or tweak them in a way or another - just let me know.

Current task:
- add field pricing options
- add possibility to lease fields (60% done - leasing happens in the game's map overview with a button that's visible if you can buy the selected farmland)
- change functions so that you are not permitted to construct on leased farmlands (as price is per field ha and not farmland ha anyway) - brainstormed already

Features:
- tabbed InGame menu (accessible with L_SHIFT+O)
- helper AI costs configurable including two time-based factors (e.g. for nighttime work)
- settings are saved in a separate xml-file in the savegame's folder

TODOs:
- populate the other areas with factors for different buying prices (within reason)
- maybe overthink existing features
- maybe add the option to let different values fluctuate over time
